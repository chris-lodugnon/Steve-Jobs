            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. His biological parents were Syrian immigrant Abdulfattah Jandali and American student Joanne Schieble, who decided to put him up for adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple, adopted him, nurturing his early years in the burgeoning Silicon Valley, where technical innovation was already in the air.</p>
            <p>From a young age, Jobs exhibited an insatiable curiosity and a penchant for tinkering with electronics. This fascination led him to attend Reed College in Portland, Oregon, albeit only for a short time before dropping out. Nevertheless, his time at Reed exposed him to calligraphy, a course that would later influence his emphasis on design and aesthetics in his technological endeavors.</p>
            <p>In 1976, Jobs, along with his friend Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, founded Apple Computer, Inc. in the Jobs family garage. Their vision was to create user-friendly personal computers, which at the time were a far cry from the complex machines prevalent in the market. The release of the Apple I and later the Apple II catapulted the company into the spotlight, laying the foundation for its future success.
            <p>Despite the early success of Apple, tensions within the company led to Jobs being ousted in 1985. Undeterred, he went on to found NeXT, a computer platform development company, and acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which would become Pixar Animation Studios. Jobs's time away from Apple allowed him to further hone his skills as a visionary leader and a master of innovation.
            <p>In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back into the fold. His return marked a turning point for the company, which was struggling at the time. With his keen eye for design and uncompromising standards, Jobs revitalized Apple's product line, launching iconic products such as the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. These devices not only revolutionized their respective industries but also cemented Apple's status as a leader in consumer electronics.
            <p>Throughout his career, Jobs was known for his intense drive, perfectionism, and willingness to challenge the status quo. His legendary product launches, marked by his charismatic stage presence and "one more thing" surprises, captivated audiences and set the bar for tech unveilings. Jobs's insistence on simplicity and seamless integration between hardware and software became hallmarks of Apple's products, earning the company a devoted following of customers.
            <p>Steve Jobs's impact extended far beyond the realm of technology. His emphasis on innovation, design, and user experience left an indelible mark on multiple industries, inspiring countless entrepreneurs and creatives worldwide. Even after his passing in 2011, Jobs's legacy continues to shape the way we interact with technology and serves as a reminder of the transformative power of vision and perseverance.
